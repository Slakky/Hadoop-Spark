# This is the A1 lab report

Answer the following questions:
1. Look at the contents of the folder â`output`â - what are the files place in there? What do
they mean?

There are two files: `_SUCCESS` and `part-r-0000`. The first file is a file generated by the MapReduce program in order to let the user know that the run was successfull. The second file is the wordcount itself, with the `key, value` pairs corresponding to the word found on the text followed by the number of occurrences. 

2. In this example we used Hadoop in Local (Standalone) Mode. What is the difference
between this mode and the Pseudo-distributed mode?
