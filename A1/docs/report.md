# This is the A1 lab report

#Task 1.1

Answer the following questions:
1. Look at the contents of the folder â`output`â - what are the files place in there? What do
they mean?

There are two files: `_SUCCESS` and `part-r-0000`. The first file is a file generated by the MapReduce program in order to let the user know that the run was successfull. The second file is the wordcount itself, with the `key, value` pairs corresponding to the word found on the text followed by the number of occurrences. 

2. In this example we used Hadoop in Local (Standalone) Mode. What is the difference
between this mode and the Pseudo-distributed mode?

The standalone mode is supposed to work by itself as a single Java program on the machine. It uses the machine FileSystem. 

The pseudo-distributed mode uses Hadoop as a daemon on the machine and it uses several nodes to work, simulating a pseudo-cluster. There may be different Hadoop daemons working at different VM but on a single machine. It uses Hadoop's File System (HDFS).

## Task 1.2

Answer the following questions:
1. What are the roles of the files core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml ?


2. Describe briefly the roles of the different services listed when executing ‘jps’.


## Task 1.3

Answer the following questions:

1. Explain the roles of the different classes in the file WordCount.java
2. What is HDFS, and how is it different from the local filesystem on your VM?

## Task 1.4
